The Commando Engine (COMMANDO) is a framework for developing arcade-style games for the PC and Xbox 360.  Built in C# using the XNA 3.0 development platform, COMMANDO is a fast engine with all of the structures needed to get a game running quickly.  It was also utilized as part of two research projects in distributed artificial intelligence, one on multi-agent communication and the other on multi-agent planning.

Note: In order to install the Commando Engine, you will have to install the Microsoft .NET Framework and the XNA 3.0 Redistributable Refresh (if they are not already installed).

Features:
  * Separate threads for updating and drawing to utilize power of Xbox 360
  * Effective implementation of state pattern for transitioning between various game modes such as menus, levels, credits, etc.
  * Collision detection using the separating-axis technique for convex polygons
  * XML formats and parsers for animations, levels, etc.
  * In-game level editor
  * Implementation of fast A`*` pathfinding so that enemies can navigate through levels
  * Pluggable framework for goal-oriented action planning with team coordination techniques
  * Simulation model for multi-agent communication
  * Content reader for user-defined XML types which don’t meet XNA requirements
  * Random number generation using various statistical models
  * Controller abstraction so you don’t have to program for both PC and Xbox 360
